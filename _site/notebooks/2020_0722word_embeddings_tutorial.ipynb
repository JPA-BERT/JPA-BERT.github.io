        "Word embeddings are dense vectors of real numbers, one per word in your vocabulary. \n",
        "In NLP, it is almost always the case that your features are words! \n",
        "But how should you represent a word in a computer? \n",
        "You could store its ascii character representation, but that only tells you what the word *is*, it doesn't say much about what it *means* (you might be able to derive its part of speech from its affixes, or properties from its capitalization, but not much). Even more, in what sense could you combine these representations? \n",
        "We often want dense outputs from our neural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where $V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for instance). \n",
        "How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller dimensional space?\n",
        "\n",
        "How about instead of ascii representations, we use a one-hot encoding?\n",

        "\n",
        "where the 1 is in a location unique to $w$. Any other word will have a 1 in some other location, and a 0 everywhere else.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is an enormous drawback to this representation, besides just how huge it is. It basically treats all words as independent entities with no relation to each other. \n",
        "What we really want is some notion of *similarity* between words. Why? Let's see an example.\n",

        "It is a technique to combat the sparsity of linguistic data, by connecting the dots between what we have seen and what we haven't. \n",
        "This example of course relies on a fundamental linguistic assumption: that words appearing in similar contexts are related to each other semantically. \n",

        "How can we solve this problem? That is, how could we actually encode semantic similarity in words? \n",
        "Maybe we think up some semantic attributes. \n",
        "For example, we see that both mathematicians and physicists can run, so maybe we give these words a high score for the \"is able to run\" semantic attribute. Think of some other attributes, and imagine what you might score some common words on those attributes.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\\begin{align}\\text{Similarity}(\\text{physicist}, \\text{mathematician}) = q_\\text{physicist} \\cdot q_\\text{mathematician}\\end{align}\n",

        "\n",
        "Where $\\phi$ is the angle between the two vectors. That way, extremely similar words (words whose embeddings point in the same direction) will have similarity 1. Extremely dissimilar words should have similarity -1.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can think of the sparse one-hot vectors from the beginning of this section as a special case of these new vectors we have defined, where each word basically has similarity 0, and we gave each word some unique semantic attribute. \n",
        "These new vectors are *dense*, which is to say their entries are (typically) non-zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "But these new vectors are a big pain: you could think of thousands of different semantic attributes that might be relevant to determining similarity, and how on earth would you set the values of the different attributes? Central to the idea of deep learning is that the neural network learns representations of the features, rather than requiring the programmer to design them herself. \n",
        "So why not just let the word embeddings be parameters in our model, and then be updated during training? \n",
        "This is exactly what we will do. We will have some *latent semantic attributes* that the network can, in principle, learn. \n",
        "Note that the word embeddings will probably not be interpretable. \n",
        "That is, although with our hand-crafted vectors above we can see that mathematicians and physicists are similar in that they both like coffee, if we allow a neural network to learn the embeddings and see that both mathematicians and physicists have a large value in the second dimension, it is not clear what that means. \n",
        "They are similar in some latent semantic dimension, but this probably has no interpretation to us.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, **word embeddings are a representation of the *semantics* of a word, efficiently encoding semantic information that might be relevant to the task at hand**. \n",

        "These will be keys into a lookup table. That is, embeddings are stored as a $|V| \\times D$ matrix, where $D$ is the dimensionality of the embeddings, such that the word assigned index $i$ has its embedding stored in the $i$'th row of the matrix. \n",
